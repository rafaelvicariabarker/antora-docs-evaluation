== Project structure
Antora requires a very specific project structure https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/standard-directories/.

== Level 0 sections
Asciidoctor does not like the use of level 0 sections in article doctypes

== Image Folder
When Antora finds an image tag-in a document, it searches for the image in the images folder. Because the documentation currently has the images/ folder in every file path, the images folder has to contain another images folder. Otherwise, images/ has to be deleted in every file path.

== Rename Asciidoc
Antora does not recognize the .asciidoc file ending. Every file has to be chaged to .adoc

== xref vs link
Internal documents need to be tagged with xref: and external websites need to be tagged with link:app-name: 

== Other Asciidoctor errors/warnings
Asciidoctor throws errors such as "id assigned to section already" and "skipping reference to missing attribute: app"
